# Impact-printing

This assignment aims to develop novel methods and techniques for the aggregation of soil-based material through a fast remote deposition process in order to build non-standard and sustainable architectural structures with an autonomous excavator.

The built outcome will have real-world significance and applicability to the Swiss building sector and beyond, paving the way for new means of sustainable construction.

This research will advance sustainable construction systems that can be directly sourced from the construction site and then re-used in construction.

Since this topic is still an on-going phd's thesis which hasen't been published yet, so we need to keep it's confidential. But during the design process we need to do lots of clay-printed mock-ups which can represent the final prototype made by impact printing methods.

So here all the codes and images are about clay printing which can demonstrate impact printing technique to certain extent.
